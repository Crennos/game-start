Cory: Basically the program just crashes because it can't read something you've put into the code and that causes it to shut down and return an error.

Cory: That error, I think, is the 'breakpoint', and it can range from something as simple to just a misplaced letter or character or a complex issue...

Cory: I can try to just Debug it but I'm... not really sure how to read this error log... so I should try to Test around so I have more things I can work with...
