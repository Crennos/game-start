~ letting_go

Narrator: This is the part where other games would flash a text across the screen declaring a 'Game Over', 'You Died' or some other moniker to represent one's failure.
Narrator: In this game, however, there will be no such moniker. 
Narrator: In this life too often have we come to associate failure with something negative, something bad, something undesirable.
Narrator: This plight is so prevalent and, in some, so powerful that it can prove paralyzing, terrifying even and so many of us consciously avoid the risk of failure. 

Narrator: Sometimes you can win through perseverance.
Narrator: Motivation.
Narrator: Patience.
Narrator: Focus.
Narrator: Creativity.
Narrator: We all know the traits that can lead one to success. Yet sometimes even who possess these in excess fall short, no matter how often they try.
Narrator: Or the cost of their success is anxiety, lethargy, frailty, depression and other such prices.
Narrator: Sometimes it is not best to succeed. Just as we have cursed failure unjustly so too have we glorified success undeservedly as well.
Narrator: An excess of success can prove every bit as cancerous as a sleuth of failures under the right circumstances.

Narrator: Thus it is with this in mind I posit the idea that just as success should not be so readily uplifted as a guiding ideal nor should failure should put under as a shameful indictment.

Narrator: Life is not so simple a thing. Sometimes you may succeed through your strengths, luck or with the support of others.
Narrator: But sometimes success is failing and realizing in failure that the only way to succeed in the game is not to play... and simply learn to walk away.
